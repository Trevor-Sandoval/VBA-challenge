# VBA-challenge

This project analyzed stock market data for 3 years (2018, 2019, 2020) using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). 
The objective is to create a script that will loop through all of the stocks for 1 year for each run and absorb the following information:

The TICKER symbol.
Yearly change from OPENING PRICE at the BEGINNING of a given year to the CLOSING PRICE at the END of that year.
The PERCENT CHANGE from the OPENING PRICE at the BEGINNING of a given year to the CLOSING PRICE at the END of that year.
The TOTAL STOCK VOLUME of the stock.

Please note that some portions of my code's structure were inspired by my research on the internet. At the beginning of this boot camp, we were encouraged to be proactive with utilizing the internet as a resource for finding solutions to complex problems that also contributed to our edification. Thus, I was able to formulate my assignment after conducting some independent research on Stack Overflow and Google Search.
